# West Chester University Hackathon 2019

With 24 to create any fun project, my team of 3 created an Arduino Pacman game visible on individually accessible LEDs.

We soldered all the LEDs in a 14 by 14 grid with gaps in between some rows and columns. Those LEDs were then connected to an Arduino running our C program which consistent of 1 Pacman and 1 enemy which would chase the Pacman around the grid. The player would use 4 buttons connected to the Arduino to attempt to collect all pellets while avoiding the enemy. Once all pellets were collected, a victory flash would occur and the game would reset. The game was about average difficulty and was coded in 1 hour.
